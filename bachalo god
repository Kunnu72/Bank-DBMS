Create:
CREATE TABLE branch
( branch_name VARCHAR(15),
branch_city VARCHAR(15),
assets NUMBER(10,2),
PRIMARY KEY(branch_name)
);
CREATE TABLE account
( accno INTEGER(8),
branch_name VARCHAR(15),
balance NUMBER(10,2),
PRIMARY KEY(accno),
FOREIGN KEY(branch_name) REFERENCES branch(branch_name)ON DELETE
CASCADE );
CREATE TABLE customer

iii. Find all the customers who have at least two accounts at the Main branch.

SELECT customer_name
FROM depositor d,account a
WHERE d.accno=a.accno
AND a.branch_name='Main'
GROUP BY d.customer_name
HAVING COUNT(d.customer_name)>=2;
 
Empty set (0.00 sec)
updating can be done with the following commands.
UPDATE account SET branch_name='Main' WHERE branch_name="b1";
UPDATE account SET branch_name='Main' WHERE branch_name="b2";
UPDATE account SET customer_name='cust1' WHERE customer_name="cust2";
+---------------+
| customer_name |
+---------------+
| cust1 |
+---------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
iv. Find all the customers who have an account at all the branches located in a specific city.

SELECT d.customer_name
FROM account a,branch b,depositor d
WHERE b.branch_name=a.branch_name AND
a.accno=d.accno AND
b.branch_city='c3'
GROUP BY d.customer_name
HAVING COUNT(distinct b.branch_name)=(
SELECT COUNT(branch_name)
FROM branch
WHERE branch_city='c3');
+---------------+
| customer_name |
+---------------+
| cust3 |
+---------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
v. Demonstrate how you delete all account tuples at every branch located in a specific city.

DELETE FROM account WHERE branch_name IN(SELECT branch_name FROM branch
WHERE branch_city='c5');
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.04 sec)
SELECT * FROM account;

+-------+-------------+---------+
| accno | branch_name | balance |
+-------+-------------+---------+
| 12 | b1 | 3000 |
| 22 | b2 | 4000 |
| 32 | b3 | 5000 |
| 42 | b4 | 6000 |
+-------+-------------+---------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)


vi.Find the names of all depositor of a specific branch.

select distinct d.customer_name
from depositor d, account a
where a.accno = d.accno AND
a.branch_name = "Raj Bhavan";

vii.find the details of all the loan holder of a specific branch.

select distinct b.customer_name
from borrower b, loan l
where l.loan_number = b.loan_number
AND l.branch_name = "KS LAyout";
